[heading h2] Looking for a unique gift?

[paragraphs] Town Hall has the answer. For only $100, you can get a book of tickets for all of the remaining speakers. And the bargain includes a second book of tickets for a companion.

Or, for $50, you can give yourself the gift of our speakers, and still get an extra ticket for a companion, but for just one of the events.
