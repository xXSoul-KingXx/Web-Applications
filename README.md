In this file I will list, on a daily-based schedule, what I've worked on.

  10/31/2025  completed chapter 3 of Murach's Html & Css, build my first Html page as exercise, "Town Hall", using Html.
  11/01/2025  halfway through chapter 4 of Murach's Html & Css, set my github profile up, also to in a way keep track of the progress.
  11/02/2025  completed chapter 4 of Murach's Html & Css, build two Web Pages with Html & Css, 
          the first I recreated a full example from scratch using what I've learned, the second an exercise, which I tweaked in order to make the page more appealing, 
          and consisted in making the styles for the "Town Hall" Website.
