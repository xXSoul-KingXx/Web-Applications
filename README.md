In this file I will list, on a daily-based schedule, what I've worked on.

  10/31/2025  finished chapter 3 of Murach's Html & Css, build my first Html page as exercise, "Town Hall", using Html.
  11/01/2025  halfway through chapter 4 of Murach's Html & Css, set my github profile up, also to in a way keep track of the progress.
