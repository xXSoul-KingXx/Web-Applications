                <p>
                    Town Hall has the answer. 
                    For only $100, you can get a book of tickets for all of the remaining speakers. 
                    And the bargain includes a second book of tickets for a companion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or, for $50, you can give yourself the gift of our speakers, 
                    and still get an extra ticket for a companion, 
                    but for just one of the events.
