                <p>
                    San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization 
                    that is run by an all-volunteer board or directors. 
                    Our mission is to bring nationally and internationally renowned, 
                    thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, 
                    and entertain our audience! 
                    As one of our members told us:
                    <blockquote>
                        Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. 
                        I think of it as the gift of knowledge...and that is priceless.
